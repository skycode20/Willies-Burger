  ## Description    

  Willie's Burger is a unique application where you can digitally grab a bite to eat from Harlem's famous burger joint. 

  My inspiration behind this project was to create a lighthearted and fun application that's enjoyable for all ages. The user can enter a burger they want to eat, the burger pops up on the left side of the app, then they can devour it. Once it is devoured the burger moves over to the right side of the app in the devoured section. The application remembers all of the burgers consumed. This is a good way for the user to keep track of how much they've eaten!

  The main challenge with this project has been troubleshooting the deployment of the application on Heroku. It runs absolutely fine locally but I keep getting an application error from Heroku.

Consequently the application never successfully launched despite being deployed successfully. 

My aspirations for the future of this application are to expand its functionality to do the following:
- Connect to real burger restaurants to receive the desired burgers from their customers to actually be able to fulfill the order. Once the order is complete the customer can log in their app that it was devoured and write a review on the burger.
- Have the ability to sync to food journals so the users can keep track of their calorie intake with ease.
